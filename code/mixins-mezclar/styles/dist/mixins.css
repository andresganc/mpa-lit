Mixins
Some things in CSS are a bit tedious to write, especially with CSS3 and the many vendor prefixes that exist. 
A mixin lets you make groups of CSS declarations that you want to reuse throughout your site. 
You can even pass in values to make your mixin more flexible. A good use of a mixin is for vendor prefixes. 
Here's an example for transform.

*/
.box {
  -webkit-transform: rotate(30deg);
  -ms-transform: rotate(30deg);
  transform: rotate(30deg);
}
