Mixins
Some things in CSS are a bit tedious to write, especially with CSS3 and the many vendor prefixes that exist. 
A mixin lets you make groups of CSS declarations that you want to reuse throughout your site. 
You can even pass in values to make your mixin more flexible. A good use of a mixin is for vendor prefixes. 
Here's an example for transform.

*/

/*
@mixin transform($property) {
    -webkit-transform: $property;
    -ms-transform: $property;
    transform: $property;
  }
  .box { @include transform(rotate(30deg)); }
*/

@import './nav';


* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

.header {
  
   @include menu-01;
  
    
}

  

  
  
}
