Extend/Inheritance

This is one of the most useful features of Sass. Using @extend lets you share a set of CSS properties from one selector to another. 
It helps keep your Sass very DRY. In our example we're going to create a simple series of messaging for errors, 
warnings and successes using another feature which goes hand in hand with extend, placeholder classes. 
A placeholder class is a special type of class that only prints when it is extended, 
and can help keep your compiled CSS neat and clean.
